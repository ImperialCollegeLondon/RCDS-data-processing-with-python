# Data Processing with Python Pandas

This workshop introduces the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) package, which supports data processing in python.

Pandas makes it easier to build workflows that move between different kinds of task:

* Reading tabular data
* Tidying data
* Transforming data
* Data visualisation
* Applying statistical tests

This workshop assumes a basic familiarity with the python language, as covered in the [Introduction to Python](https://github.com/coolernato/Introduction-to-Python) workshop.


## Setup

We will be working with python using jupyter notebooks. The easiest way to access jupyter is via the Anaconda platform.

Please install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com in advance of the first session.


## Getting Started

Download this repository to your computer as a ZIP file and unpack it.

Open JupyterLab (within Anaconda) and navigate to the unpacked directory to work with the .ipynb notebooks.

Alternatively, you can run the notebooks online using Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/johnpinney/data_processing_with_python/master?urlpath=lab)
